# AI Dashboard Workflow Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Excel File Upload Integration** ✅
**Problem**: Excel files uploaded through React frontend weren't accessible to the AI backend.

**Solution**:
- Updated `AIDashboardGenerator.js` to upload Excel data to simple-backend first
- Modified AI backend to prioritize `simple-backend/uploads` directory when searching for Excel files
- Added proper file path handling in the API communication

### 2. **Standalone Dashboard Generator Enhancement** ✅
**Problem**: The `dashboard-generator.html` interface only accepted prompts, no Excel file uploads.

**Solution**:
- Added Excel file upload capability to the HTML interface
- Integrated with simple-backend for file processing
- Updated the workflow to upload files before generating dashboards

### 3. **Backend Communication** ✅
**Problem**: Node.js backend and AI backend didn't share Excel files properly.

**Solution**:
- AI backend now searches in `simple-backend/uploads` directory first
- Proper file path passing between services
- Added fallback mechanisms for data handling

### 4. **Workflow Integration** ✅
**Problem**: Disconnected services with no proper data flow.

**Solution**:
- Complete end-to-end integration from file upload to dashboard generation
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- Status checking and validation

## Complete Workflow Now Works

### Option 1: React Frontend Workflow
1. **File Upload**: Upload Excel file through React interface
2. **Data Processing**: File gets processed and stored in simple-backend
3. **AI Generation**: Enter prompt in AI Dashboard Generator section
4. **Dashboard Creation**: AI backend receives file path and creates Streamlit dashboard

### Option 2: Standalone HTML Interface
1. **File Upload**: Upload Excel file directly in dashboard-generator.html
2. **Prompt Entry**: Describe desired dashboard
3. **Generation**: Click generate to create AI-powered dashboard
4. **Result**: Get live Streamlit dashboard URL

## How to Test

### Prerequisites
1. **Ollama Setup**:
   ```bash
   ollama serve
   ollama pull llama3
   ```

2. **Start Services**:
   - Run `start_workflow_test.bat` (Windows)
   - Or manually start all three services:
     - AI Backend: `cd ai-backend && python app.py`
     - Simple Backend: `cd simple-backend && node server.js`
     - React Frontend: `cd frontend && npm start`

### Testing Steps
1. Open React app at http://localhost:3000
2. Upload an Excel file with manufacturing/operational data
3. Scroll to "AI Dashboard Generator" section
4. Enter a prompt like: "Create a manufacturing performance dashboard with lane analysis and OEE metrics"
5. Click "Generate AI Dashboard"
6. Wait for Streamlit dashboard to be generated and displayed

### Alternative Testing
1. Open `dashboard-generator.html` in browser
2. Upload Excel file
3. Enter manufacturing dashboard prompt
4. Generate dashboard directly

## Technical Implementation Details

### File Flow
```
Excel File → React Upload → Simple Backend (/uploads) → AI Backend → SQLite → Dashboard Code → Streamlit
```

### API Endpoints
- **File Upload**: `POST /Dataset/Upload` (Simple Backend)
- **Dashboard Generation**: `POST /api/dashboard/generate` (AI Backend)
- **Status Check**: `GET /api/status` (AI Backend)

### Data Processing
1. Excel → JSON conversion (Simple Backend)
2. Data analysis and field categorization
3. File storage with metadata
4. AI backend retrieval and SQLite conversion
5. LLM code generation with actual data context
6. Streamlit dashboard creation and hosting

## Sample Data Schema Support

The system now properly handles the shipment/logistics schema you described:
- **GrossQuantity**: Numeric shipment quantities
- **FlowRate**: Operational flow rates
- **BayCode/Lane**: Manufacturing lane/bay identifiers
- **ScheduledDate**: Planning and ETA dates
- **ExitTime/CreatedTime**: Operational timing data
- **Product Codes**: Product mix analysis
- **Shipment IDs**: Tracking and compartment data

The AI backend generates appropriate manufacturing dashboards with:
- Lane/Bay performance analysis
- Throughput and capacity metrics
- Schedule vs Actual adherence
- OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) calculations
- Shift pattern analysis
- Product mix insights

## Error Handling

The system now includes proper error handling for:
- Missing Excel files
- Ollama connection issues
- File upload failures
- Dashboard generation timeouts
- Service communication errors

Each component provides clear feedback to users about issues and next steps.
